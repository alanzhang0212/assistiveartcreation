With the continuous development of novel and revolutionary technology, the creation of art has become more easily accessible to the general public. The plethora of free art resources (Krita, Artweaver Free, Microsoft Paint, etc.) available online testifies to this. However, there is one demographic that is underrepresented: those with limited physical mobility. In this research, we aim to assist amputees and those with limited dexterity. The purpose of our research project is to investigate the possibility of using technology to provide this group with more opportunities to create art. To achieve this, our research focuses on creating a program that converts music or audio input into digital, generative art. Our program not only presents users with a new medium in which they can construct artwork, but also demonstrates a new interpretation of music and sound. This program is coded in Processing and uses its built-in sound library alongside an audio analysis library in Minim. By implementing an audio-reactive interface rather than a conventional graphical user interface, the authors provide a novel system that is fundamentally more inclusive. We hope that this program will aid those with limited mobility in artistic expression.
